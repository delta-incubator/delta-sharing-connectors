# Overview
Thanks for considering contributing to the Delta Sharing Connectors! We happily welcome all code contributions. Generally speaking, we use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-sharing-connectors/issues) to track community reported issues and [GitHub Pull Requests ](https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-sharing-connectors/pulls) for accepting changes.

# Governance
Delta Sharing governance is conducted by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which is currently composed of the following members:
 - Michael Armbrust (michael.armbrust@gmail.com)
 - Reynold Xin (reynoldx@gmail.com)
 - Matei Zaharia (matei@cs.stanford.edu)

The founding technical charter can be found [here](https://delta.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/delta-charter.pdf).

# Communication
Before starting work on a major feature, please reach out to us via GitHub, Slack, email, etc. We will make sure no one else is already working on it and ask you to open a GitHub issue.
A "major feature" is defined as any change that is > 100 LOC altered (not including tests), or changes any user-facing behavior.
We will use the GitHub issue to discuss the feature and come to agreement.
This is to prevent your time being wasted, as well as ours.
The GitHub review process for major features is also important so that organizations with commit access can come to agreement on design.
If it is appropriate to write a design document, the document must be hosted either in the GitHub tracking issue, or linked to from the issue and hosted in a world-readable location.
Specifically, if the goal is to add a new extension, please read the extension policy.
Small patches and bug fixes don't need prior communication.

# Coding style
We generally follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

# Sign your work
The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from developercertificate.org):

```

    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source

```

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with git commit -s.
